# Welcome to Bankers.py!

Bankers is a card game made by Earth while brainstorming stupidity (until otherwise found). Bankers **.py** is a text-based version of this card game coded in Python 3, because Earth had nothing better to do on a Sunday night.

This README will introduce to you the proper setup for the Python file, as well as provide a how-to guide on playing the game! There is also a how-to-play tutorial in the game proper, if you really need it.

# Getting started

Installing and setting up Bankers.py is fairly straightforward.

# Playing the game

## How to play Bankers

Bankers, in this iteration, is a solo game of you versus the House. You'll start with $1000, and you will bet on exactly how likely it is you'll match your card to the House before it matches to you.

You'll be prompted to make your bet of up to 3/4ths your current wallet (e.g. if you have $1000, you can only bet as high at $750). Once you've done that, you'll be given two cards out of a standard 52-card deck. Then, the House will reveal its card. Choose a card from your hand; if it matches the card the House revealed, you've won! Collect your bet doubled. 

If it doesn't, the House will reveal another card. If the House matches the card you played, you lose your bet! If it doesn't, play continues as it did prior.

## Configuring Bankers.py

Some slight configuration can be done to Bankers.py, such as how certain things are displayed, how many cards you want yourself or the House to draw, and so on. This can all be done before you start a game in the Main Menu.
